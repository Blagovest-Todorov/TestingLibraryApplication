Add a book Functionality;

Book's properties should answer to certain requirements:
Id - positive int; 
Author - string, not longer than 30 chars.(from 31 chars inclusive is not allowed)
Title - string, not longer than 100 chars. (from 101 chars inclusive is not allowed)
Description - string, oprional.(We may have a description, may have not).

Is is a good idea the ids of the book to be entered by the users, isn't it better to be auto incremented ?
Will it be better if we have some char count limitation of the length of the Description property ?

Once added is Id possible to be changed (I have presumed that the Id field once created is immutable) ?

Into Bug6 Would it be better to throw error for the invalid Title, and Invalid Author too ?,
becasue it trwos error only for invalid Id?

On Bug8 when Updating a Book With Valid Id And Invalid Author And invalid Title it throws Error Message not for 
Invalid Author, it throws an error message only for invalid title(UpdatedTitle101CharsLength). Is it ok from 2 Properies with invalid values 
to throw an ErrorMessage only for one of them. for InvalidAuthor31CharsLength there is no error message appearing ?

What response statusCode should the Api return to us, when there are no books entered in the Application, 
when SearchString is :"", "  ", null  ?

Question is the searchResult dependant on Capital or Lower Case (CaseSensitive) i think yes ?
Should it be better if the searching is independant from Capital/Lower Case of the input string ?
