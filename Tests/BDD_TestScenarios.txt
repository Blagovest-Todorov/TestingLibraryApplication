 GET BOOKS

 Scenario # 1: Successful Get books from the system;    

Test Case 1. Get books when searching by existing exact FullTitle (FullTitle = "TestTitle1")
      Given  The user wants to get books from the system by FullTitle (books are already added to the system,
             book Title exists)
        And  The user accesses the get book end point.
        And  User fills the valid value for Book properties: Title
       When  submites the entered information.
       Then  The book is sucessfully retrieved from LibraryManager App. The book is present in the response.

       The entered books in the system are:

      Example:  | 1 | TestAuthor1 | TestTitle1      | TestDescription1        |
                | 2 | TestAuthor2 | TestTitle2      | TestDescription2        |
                | 3 | TestAuthor3 | TestTitle3      | TestDescription3        |

                | 5 | TESTAUTHOR5 | TESTTITLE5      | TESTDESCRIPTION5        |
                | 6 | testauthor6 | testtitle6      | testdescription6        |
                | 7 | testAutor7  | testTestTitle7  | TestDescription1        |
                | 8 | testAutor8  | testTESTTitle8  | TestDescription1        |
                | 9 | testAutor9  | 789             | TestDescription9        |
                | 10| testAutor10 | 789102          |

                When we search by string  FullTitle = "TestTitle1" -> the response should return this record:
                | 1 | TestAuthor1 | TestTitle1      | TestDescription1       |

               
              
 Test Case 2. Get books when searching by existing partial title (first by search string: "2", then by string = "Title2")
       Given  The user wants to get books from the system by partial title (books are already added to the system, 
              book Title exists)
         And  The user accesses the get book end point.
         And  User fills the valid value for Book properties: Title
        When  submites the entered information.
        Then  The book(s) is/are sucessfully retrieved from LibraryManager App. The book(s) is/are present in the 
              response.

        The entered books in the system are:

      Example:  | 1 | TestAuthor1 | TestTitle1      | TestDescription1        |
                | 2 | TestAuthor2 | TestTitle2      | TestDescription2        |
                | 3 | TestAuthor3 | TestTitle3      | TestDescription3        |

                | 10| testAutor10 | 789102          |

                When we search first by string  parcialTitle = "2" ,then by string = "Title2"-> the response 
                should return records:
                | 2 | TestAuthor2 | TestTitle2      | TestDescription2        |
                | 10| testAutor10 | 789102          |                         |
