Bug 1;
In Method: AddBook_AllFields_ShouldPass
AuthorProperty value in the response is null, but shoud be Ivan Vazov
var book = new Book(currentId, "Ivan Vazov", "Pod Igoto", "Hard time for BG People"); 
We compare obj book with the response. The response Author is null, whick is bug.

Bug 2:
 Is AuthorProperty is it Required ? (yes according to the ErrorMessage)
 When we pass AuthorProperty the value "", null, White space
 The response Error is:
 Message:
 String lengths are both 61.Strings differ at index 50.
 Expected: "Book.Author is a required field.\r\nParameter name: Book.Author"
 But was: "Book.Author is a required field.\r\nParameter name: book.Author"
 book.Author in the message should me with Capital "B"
 When AuthorProperty is 31Symbols test passes, becasue validation works.

Bug 3 :
in Method :public void AddABook_InvalidAuthor_ShouldFail
here we set negative or Empty Author and it is registered ie, we receive response with payload and HttpStatusCode "OK" and no Error.
It should be Error in the response, and empty payload and HttpStatusCode "BadRequest".
We can not enter Book with Invalid Author(empty Author, Author more than 30Symbols....);

Bug 4:
 In Method : public void AddBook_ValidAuthor_ShouldPass

 Entering book with Author 30 Symbols length should be allowed according to the requirements.
 In practice the responseObject has Error, ErrorMessage ->Book.Author should not exceed 30 characters!, 
 the payload is Empty, the Response HttpStatuscode is BadRequest, object book is not present into the response- which is all wrong.
 It should be Error is Empty, payload is full, and HttpStatusCode is "OK". Object book should be present into the Response.
 Entering a book with Author Length 1 Symbol. Into the Response the Author is with nullValue, 
 it should be Author with Value "I";


Bug 5 : 
In Method : public void AddBook_ValidTitle_ShouldPass
Adding book with Title length 100 chars is possible accroding to the requirements. 
  The Response with Title length is 100 Chars is not added, which is not correct.
  There is Error, Error Message (Adding book failed, Book.Title should not exceed 100 characters!),
  HttpStatusCode is "BadRequest" which not correct.
  Book with Title Lenght 100 should be possible present/added into the Response, HttpStatuscode should be "OK". 
  Error must be null.

 Question : Is it allowed id Value to be changed ? (no). Is it Required (Yes)

Bug 6:
In the method : UpdateBook_AuthorContains31Symbols_ShouldFail -> the ErrorMessage: 
log as a probable Bug : ....book.Author, book needs to be with capital B (Book.Author)
            Message:
            String lengths are both 61.Strings differ at index 50.
            Expected: "Book.Author is a required field.\r\nParameter name: Book.Author"
            But was:  "Book.Author is a required field.\r\nParameter name: book.Author"

Bug 7:
 In Method: public void UpdateBook_AuthorContainsExactly30Symbols_ShouldPass

 when i pass 30 characters long Author, throws Error with ErrorMessage,
 that Authour should not exeed 30 characters, which is not correct behaviour. 
 It should not throw Error.  
 By requirements Author validation should not throw Error if Author length is not longer than 30 symbols. 
 It means thatv if length is 31 Symbols it throws an Error.
 Validation for 30 chars is not correctly working here.

             UpdateBook_AuthorContainsExactly30Symbols_ShouldPass("Ivan VazovIvan VazovIvan Vazov")
             Message: 
             Expected: null
             But was:  <LibraryManagerTests.Models.Error>

Bug 8:
 in Method : UpdateBook_TitleContains100Symbols_ShouldPass
 Validation for Title length of 100 symbols throws an Error and ErrorMessage, but it should not, becasue by
 requirements  if Title is not longer than 100  symbols it is ok. 
 If we pass Title length with 101 Symbols and more it should throw an Error.

Bug 9:
 in Method : public void UpdateBook_InvalidId_ShouldFail(int invalidId)
"Book.Id should be a positive integer!\r\nParameter name: book.Id";  
 for consistency : book.Id book must be in the error Message with Capital "B";

Bug 10:
 In Method public void UpdateBook_AllFieldsInvalid_ShouldFail
 There is no Id with value = 2 and updatedAuthor31CharsLength contains 31chars that is invalid 
 there is not ErrorMesage thrown for Book with Id = 2 and Author with length 31 Chars.
 There is only an ErrorMessage thrown for property UpdatedTitle101CharsLength which is 101 (invalid) characters.
 Is it ok from 3 Properies with invalid values to throw an ErrorMessage only for one of them 
 (UpdatedTitle101CharsLength) and for the other not ?.
 description field is correct -> there is no litmitations for it

Bug 11:
  Method: UpdateBook_EmptyDescription_ShouldPass 
  Message: 
  Expected string length 59 but was 58. Strings differ at index 30.
  Expected: "Book.Title is a required field.\r\nParameter name: Book.Title"
  But was:  "Book.Title is a required field\r\nParameter name: Book.Title"
  -----------------------------------------^ // There should be a "."  at the end of this sentence
  ("Book.Title is a required field)
  for consistenscy with the other 
  Required field Error messages

 Bug 12 :
 In Method : AddABook_NoDescriptionOrWhiteSpace_ShouldPass
  
  In the Document there is no limitation of the Description fieled length. 
  Would not it better we to have some field length limitation here?

Bug 13:
In Method : AddBook_AllFieldsInvalid_ShouldFail

 From the 3 Book Properies it throws Error only on invalid Title Length -> InvalidTitle101CharsLength, 
 Would it be better to throw error for the invalid Id, and Invalid Author ?
 for Descripion we dont have limitations but we should 

 Questions: Adding a book with same Id/Author/Title/Description what is the expected behaviour, is it allowed?
