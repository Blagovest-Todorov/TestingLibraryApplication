Bug1 -  NullAuthorPropertyValueInResponseWhenBookAuthourIsAdded. 

Step 1. Navigate to URL Page http://localhost:9000/api/books where we can add book.
Step 2. Fill book properties (Id = 1, Author = "TestAuthor", Title = "TestTitle1", Description = "TestDescription"),
        and when we check in the response the book property Auhtor, Author has null value,  but it should has
        a value = "TestAuthor", that represents a probable bug.
                      Expected value of Author is : "TestAuthor"
                      Actual value is : null;


Bug2 - NoLimitationForTheLengthOfDescriptionField - In the Requirements there is no limitation of length 
       about the Description field. Would it be better we to have some field length limitation here ? 
       This could be a probable requirement bug.

        
Bug3 - UnexpectedMessageAppearsWhenEnteringAuthorFieldWithLength30Chars. 
Step1. Navigate to URL Page http://localhost:9000/api/books where we can add book.

       according to the requirements and then unexpected message appears: 
                                      "Book.Author should not exceed 30 characters!\r\nParameter name: Book.Author"; 
       Expected: Author length 30 chars should be added/present in the response and no error message should appear. 
       Actual: Author with length 30 chars is not added/present in the response and an error message appears.
                                     "Book.Author should not exceed 30 characters!\r\nParameter name: Book.Author"; 
                                     That is not correct accordint to the requirements, where 30 chars is allowed.

                             String lengths are both 61.Strings differ at index 50.
          Expected: "Book.Author is a required field.\r\nParameter name: Book.Author"
           But was: "Book.Author is a required field.\r\nParameter name: book.Author"
          book.Author in the message should me with Capital "B" like(Book.Author) and probably there should be "!" 
          instead of "." symbol after the required field for consistency witht the other error messages.
       
Bug5   AddingBookTitleWithLength100CharsIsNotPossible. 
Step1. Navigate to URL Page http://localhost:9000/api/books where we can add book.

       (Adding book failed, Book.Title should not exceed 100 characters!) which not correct according to requirements. 
       Payload is null, Bad request.
       
       Expected: According to the requirements a Book with Title length 100 chars should be added and present into 
       the Response, HttpStatuscode should be "OK" and Error must be null (No error message should appear in response).

       (id = int.MinValue,  InvalidAuthor31CharsLength = "TestAuthorTestAuthorTestAuthor1", 
       InvalidTitle101CharsLength =
              "Pod Igoto Tom nice 1Pod Igoto Tom nice 1Pod Igoto Tom nice 1Pod Igoto Tom nice 1Pod Igoto Tom nice 12", 
       Description = "TestDescription")
       From the 3 invalid Book Properies it throws Error only on invalid Id  :
                                                      "Book.Id should be a positive integer!\r\nParameter name: book.Id" 
       Would it be better to throw error for the invalid Title, and Invalid Author too ?            
       Into the error Message "Book.Id should be a positive integer!\r\nParameter name: book.Id" ,
       book.Id should be corrected  to Book.Id for consistency to be one format everywhere.

        is thrown for property UpdatedTitle101CharsLength which is 101 (invalid) characters, 
        and for property Id = int.MinValue (invalid), that is correct. But is it ok from 3 Properies with invalid 
        values to throw an ErrorMessage only for two of them ? For invalid Author - there is no errormessage. 
        Description field is correct, there is no litmitations for it.
            Expected is to throw errror message for invalid Id, invalid Autor and invalid Title,
            but actual is as follows:
            
            Message:
